            <h2><strong>EVERY CHILD  MUST LEARN LITERACY PROGRAM</strong></h2>
            <hr>
            
            <h3>Overview of the program</h3>
            <p><strong>Every Child Must Learn Literacy Program</strong> is designed to ensure that 
                every Liberian child, regardless of background or ability, gains the foundational 
                reading and writing skills needed to succeed in school and life. Its vision is that every 
                child in Liberia develops strong literacy skills and cultivates a love for reading. 
                The mission is to provide systematic, evidence-based instruction while building a culture 
                of reading within homes, schools, and communities. The program emphasizes early 
                intervention, structured literacy practices, and sustainability so that literacy development 
                continues beyond the classroom.</p>
                <p>The program targets children in Kindergarten through Grade 3 as its primary focus, 
                    while also extending support to struggling readers up to Grade 6. Special provisions 
                    are made for children with learning difficulties, disabilities, or other barriers to 
                    learning by adapting teaching strategies to meet their unique needs. Entry begins with 
                    a baseline assessment, after which children are placed into tiers of instruction based 
                    on their ability level. This ensures that every learner receives the right level of 
                    support to progress effectively.</p>
                    <h3>The Science of Reading</h3>
                <p>Instruction is structured around the Science of Reading and aligned with the 
                    Orton–Gillingham approach, which emphasizes multisensory, explicit, and sequential 
                    teaching methods. Lessons focus on five core components: phonemic awareness, phonics 
                    and decoding, fluency, vocabulary development, and comprehension. Writing and spelling 
                    are integrated into the program to strengthen children’s overall literacy. To serve 
                    learners at different levels, the program is delivered in three tiers: Tier 1 provides 
                    whole-group foundational instruction, Tier 2 delivers small-group targeted intervention, 
                    and Tier 3 offers one-on-one tutoring for learners with significant challenges.</p>
                <p>The learning environment is flexible and resourceful, making use of both indoor and outdoor 
                    spaces. The indoor literacy center includes a small teaching wall, a reading nook, and 
                    group learning tables, while the outdoor space is used for reading circles, storytelling 
                    sessions, and vocabulary games. In addition, mobile book bags and a lending library extend 
                    literacy learning into homes and communities, helping children build daily 
                    reading habits.</p>
                    <h3>Staffing</h3>
                <p>Staffing is central to program success. A Program Coordinator oversees the daily operations, 
                    scheduling, and reporting, while a Lead Literacy Specialist designs lessons and trains 
                    instructors. Trained tutors and volunteers facilitate group and individual lessons, 
                    supported by a Family Engagement Officer who works directly with parents and caregivers. 
                    An Assessment Officer is responsible for conducting screenings, monitoring learner progress, 
                    and maintaining records. Volunteers are recruited, trained through a 24-hour pre-service 
                    program, and continuously supported through monthly coaching sessions to ensure effective 
                    lesson delivery.</p>
                <h3>Duration and Key Activities</h3>
                <p>The program runs on a 36-week cycle aligned with the school year. Each daily literacy 
                    block lasts 60 to 90 minutes and begins with a short phonological awareness warm-up, 
                    followed by structured phonics, fluency practice, vocabulary building, and comprehension 
                    activities. Each lesson closes with an exit ticket and updates to reading logs. Mondays 
                    through Thursdays are dedicated to instruction, while Fridays are reserved for 
                    assessments, storytelling, and Family Literacy Hours. Optional Saturday sessions provide 
                    library time, reading clubs, and catch-up tutoring.</p>
                <p>Family and community engagement is a defining feature of the program. Parents are invited to 
                    monthly Family Literacy Nights, where they learn simple strategies to support their children 
                    at home. Children borrow take-home book bags with reading logs for parents to sign, and 
                    community storytelling events bring in elders, churches, and local leaders to reinforce a 
                    culture of literacy. In addition, the program makes use of radio broadcasts and WhatsApp 
                    messages to send families weekly reading tips, ensuring that even those who cannot attend 
                    in person are engaged.</p>
                <h3>Monitoring Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Monitoring and evaluation are central to tracking learner outcomes. Entry assessments 
                    measure children’s phonics skills, oral fluency, and comprehension. Progress is tracked 
                    through bi-weekly probes and quarterly benchmarks, with results feeding into each child’s 
                    Individual Learning Plan (ILP). This data-driven approach ensures that instruction remains 
                    responsive and effective. Key expected outcomes include significant improvements in oral 
                    reading fluency, comprehension, and vocabulary, as well as high levels of parental 
                    involvement in children’s literacy journeys.</p>
                <p>Materials used in the program are both purchased and locally created. Decodable books, 
                    flashcards, sand trays, and magnetic letters form part of the instructional kit, while 
                    locally made tools such as bottle-cap letters, handmade flashcards, and chalkboards help 
                    reduce costs. Books are provided in English. A lending library system allows children to 
                    borrow books and encourages families to read together.</p>
                <h3>Safeguarding and Inclusion</h3>
                <p>Safeguarding and inclusion are prioritized throughout the program. A child protection 
                    policy governs safe sign-in and sign-out, consent for photographs, and clear referral 
                    pathways in case of concerns. Inclusive teaching practices, such as large-print texts 
                    and multisensory learning methods, ensure that children with disabilities or learning 
                    difficulties are not left behind. The program also promotes learner wellbeing through 
                    structured routines, praise, and predictable classroom environments that support 
                    emotional safety.</p>
                <h3>Financial Sustainability</h3>
                <p>Financial sustainability is achieved through a combination of donor support, volunteer 
                    engagement, and community-driven initiatives. Annual budgets cover staff stipends, 
                    training, materials, books, and monitoring systems. Cost-efficiency is enhanced by 
                    partnerships with schools, universities, NGOs, and private sponsors. Local fundraising, 
                    including book drives and branded merchandise, also supports ongoing needs.</p>
                <p>The first-year implementation timeline begins with staff and volunteer recruitment, 
                    training, and baseline assessments in the first two months. Instruction and community 
                    engagement activities run throughout the academic year, with a midline assessment at six 
                    months to adjust strategies. The program concludes with end-line assessments, learner 
                    celebrations, and reports for stakeholders. This cycle not only improves literacy outcomes 
                    but also builds long-term community commitment to children’s education.
