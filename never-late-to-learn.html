            <h2><strong>“Never Late to Learn” Literacy Program Design</strong></h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Program Overview & Theory of Change</h3>
            <p>The purpose of the “Never Late to Learn” program is to provide out-of-school youth 
                and adults with foundational literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. This will enable 
                them to access better livelihoods, participate in civic life, and support their 
                children’s education. The program’s theory of change holds that if learners receive 
                culturally relevant, trauma-informed, and multisensory literacy instruction at
                flexible times and in nearby community venues—combined with consistent practice 
                opportunities and wraparound supports—they will progress from non-reader or early
                reader to functional literacy within 6–12 months. This progression can lead to 
                improved employability, increased confidence, and the establishment of lifelong 
                learning pathways.</p>
                <p>The core principles of the program include maintaining learner dignity through 
                adult-appropriate materials, using a multisensory structured literacy approach 
                (covering phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension), 
                and building numeracy skills for daily life such as money management, measurement, 
                and time. Additionally, the program introduces digital basics, applies Universal 
                Design for Learning (UDL), and integrates Orton-Gillingham-informed strategies for 
                struggling readers. Continuous assessment and quick feedback loops ensure learners 
                stay on track.</p>
                <h3>Target Learners & Eligibility</h3>
                <p>The program primarily targets individuals aged 15 and above, especially out-of-school 
                youth and adults who read below a Grade 6 level. It also welcomes parents and caregivers 
                who want to better support their children’s homework, as well as workers seeking workplace 
                literacy. Enrollment is based on self-selection or referral, followed by a placement test 
                to group learners by ability.</p>
                <p>Learner profiles are divided into four levels. Level 1 includes those with limited 
                letter-sound knowledge. Level 2 learners can decode simple words but lack fluency. 
                Level 3 participants can read short paragraphs but struggle with inference and writing 
                mechanics. Level 4 learners are transitional, preparing for higher education, remedial 
                programs, or workplace training.</p>
                <h3>Program Objectives (by Level)</h3>
                <p>The literacy objectives vary by level. Level 1 learners master letter-sound 
                correspondences and write simple sentences. Level 2 learners decode multisyllabic 
                words and write paragraphs with punctuation. Level 3 learners read 300–500-word texts 
                with accuracy and write functional texts such as letters or CVs. Level 4 learners 
                analyze longer informational texts and produce formal reports.</p>
                <p>Numeracy objectives progress from basic number sense and operations at Level 1, 
                to personal finance and business mathematics at Level 4. Digital literacy skills are 
                integrated across all levels, covering phone fluency, safe online searches, and filling 
                electronic forms.</p>
                <h3>Delivery Model & Timetable Options</h3>
                <p>The program runs in community schools, youth centers, faith-based halls, workplaces, 
                and through mobile outreach. Class formats are flexible: a standard track 
                (three 2-hour sessions per week), an intensive track (four to five 1.5-hour sessions per 
                week), workplace classes (two 2-hour sessions), and blended learning using WhatsApp 
                micro-lessons. Class sizes range from 12–18 learners per facilitator, with volunteer 
                assistants is added for larger groups.</p>
                <p>Each cohort follows a 12-week cycle. The first two weeks focus on placement, goal 
                setting, and establishing routines. Weeks three to ten involve core instruction and 
                practice. The final two weeks focus on review, functional projects, summative assessments, 
                and a graduation ceremony.</p>
                <h3>Curriculum Structure</h3>
                <p>The curriculum is built around multiple strands: phonemic awareness, phonics and 
                morphology, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, writing, numeracy, and digital basics. 
                A weekly flow integrates phonics, reading, numeracy, comprehension, vocabulary, writing, 
                and functional projects. Learners practice real-life tasks such as reading utility bills, 
                writing CVs, creating household budgets, and mapping community directions.</p>
                <h3>Instructional Approach</h3>
                <p>The program uses structured literacy informed by Orton-Gillingham principles. 
                Instruction is explicit, cumulative, and multisensory, following the 
                “I-do/We-do/You-do” model. UDL ensures multiple methods of representation and expression, 
                with culturally relevant texts reflecting Liberian life. Trauma-informed practices, 
                such as predictable routines and positive supports help learners feel safe. Practice 
                routines include repeated readings, dictations, and small-group activities.</p>
                <h3><strong>Assessment & Placement</strong></h3>
                <p>At intake, learners complete a placement screener assessing reading, writing, 
                and numeracy. Formative assessments are conducted weekly, while summative 
                assessments at the end of each cycle measure overall progress. Learners earn 
                certificates and digital badges for each level. The program uses data-driven
                approaches to adjust instruction and provide targeted tutoring for those 
                falling behind.</p>
                <h3><strong>Staffing & Roles</strong></h3>
                <p>The program is managed by a Program Manager, supported by site coordinators, lead 
                facilitators, assistant tutors, and a safeguarding focal point. A Monitoring, Evaluation, 
                and Learning (MEL) officer oversees data systems and progress tracking. Training for 
                facilitators includes structured literacy, adult learning, safeguarding, and digital 
                pedagogy.</p>
                <h3><strong>Materials & Technology</strong></h3>
                <p>Essential teaching materials include decodable texts, readers, word cards, letter 
                tiles, and writing supplies. Local content packs feature health messages, market 
                math, and civic forms. Technology support includes WhatsApp for micro-lessons, 
                optional tablets for offline apps, and printed take-home packs for low-tech 
                learners.</p>
                <h3><strong>Learner Supports (Retention Toolkit)</strong></h3>
                <p>To improve retention, the program offers flexible schedules, childcare corners, simple 
                refreshments, and, when possible, transport stipends. Attendance nudges are delivered 
                via WhatsApp, and learners are paired with peer study buddies. Public ceremonies recognize 
                achievements and keep learners motivated.</p>
                <h3><strong>Partnerships</strong></h3>
                <p>The program collaborates with community leaders, women’s groups, youth associations, 
                and faith-based organizations for outreach and venues. Employers are engaged for workplace 
                classes, while libraries and government offices provide additional support and alignment 
                with national standards.</p>
                <h3><strong>Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL)</strong></h3>
                <p>Key indicators include enrollment, attendance, completion rates, reading fluency, 
                functional tasks, numeracy mastery, and digital skills. Data is collected through class 
                registers, assessments, and WhatsApp engagement. Quarterly learning reviews help refine 
                the program.</p>
                <h3><strong>Inclusion, Protection & Accessibility</strong></h3>
                <p>The program applies a safeguarding code of conduct, ensures confidentiality, and provides 
                gender-responsive scheduling. Learners with disabilities receive accommodations such 
                as large print or audio materials.</p>
                <h3><strong>Risk Management & Mitigation</strong></h3>
                <p>Risks such as absenteeism, venue disruptions, facilitator turnover, or learning 
                loss are mitigated through flexible makeup sessions, backup venues, trained 
                reserves, and WhatsApp lessons. Safety is maintained through alerts and daylight 
                scheduling options.</p>
                <h3><strong>Budget Framework</strong></h3>
                <p>Budget categories include personnel, training, venue costs, materials, technology, 
                learner supports, MEL activities, and contingency. </p>
                <h3><strong>Communications & Community Engagement</strong></h3>
                <p>Outreach strategies include radio spots, WhatsApp flyers, community enrollment drives, 
                and success stories shared at public events. Employer showcases demonstrate the value 
                of workplace classes.</p>
                <h3><strong>Implementation Timeline</strong></h3>
                <p>In the first month, staff and volunteers are recruited, sites are finalized, and 
                materials are procured. Training and placement happen in month two, with classes 
                beginning thereafter. Instruction continues in months three and four, followed by 
                assessments and celebrations in month five. Month six focuses on reviewing lessons 
                learned and scaling to additional sites.</p>
                <h3><strong>Weekly & Session Templates</strong></h3>
                <p>A sample weekly timetable includes three evening classes covering phonics, reading, 
                numeracy, comprehension, writing, review, functional projects, and digital tasks. 
                Each 90-minute session follows a structured format: welcome, phonics, guided reading, w
                riting, numeracy or digital practice, and reflection. Lesson plan and assessment templates 
                ensure consistent delivery.</p>
                <h3><strong>Recognition, Transitions & Pathways</strong></h3>
                <p>Certificates and badges mark learner progress. Graduates transition to remedial programs, 
                vocational training, or workplace opportunities. Alumni are encouraged to return as 
                mentors or volunteer assistants.</p>
                <h3><strong>Scalability & Sustainability</strong></h3>
                <p>The program begins with one or two cohorts per site, documenting outcomes to build a 
                case for scaling. Sustainability is supported through facilitator pipelines, local content 
                development, employer co-funding, and community contributions.</p>
                <h3><strong>Appendices</strong></h3>
                <p>The program includes practical tools such as sample enrollment forms, safeguarding codes, 
                attendance registers, learner surveys, and volunteer role descriptions. These ensure smooth 
                implementation and accountability.</p>
