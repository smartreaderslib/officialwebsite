            <h2><strong>VISUALLY IMPAIRED LITERACY PROGRAM</strong></h2>
            <hr>
                <p>Smart Readers's Visually Impaired" Literacy Program is designed
                to empower children and young adults with visual impairments by equiping them with functional
                literacy skills, life skills, and confidence to participate fully in schooland community life.
                The program aims to teach braille, tactile literacy large-print reading, and listerning
                comprehension, while building orintation, mobility, and independent learning strategies.
                In addition to fostering literacy, the program supports inclusive education by training
                mainstream teacheers and caregivers. The program also  focuses on measurable outcomes, such
                as reading fluency, comprehension, and School retension rate.</p>
            <p>The program primarily serves children age <strong>4 - 18</strong> with visual impairments, 
                including both low-vision and blind students, while also engaging parents, caregivers, and 
                mainstream teachers to support their learning.The beneficiaries of the program are identified
                through community outreach, school referrals, and health clinics networks. Upon enrollment, each
                learner undergoes a streening and baseline assessment. The assessement is aimed at evaluating
                the learner's visual levels, prior schooling, braille readiness, auditory comprehension,and
                motor skills. This ensures that each child's individual learning needs are accurately understood
                from the onset.</p>
            <p>Once assessed, the learners are provided  with <strong>Individual Learning Plans (ILPs)</strong> 
                that outline specific, measurable activities. For example, a goal  may be for a student
                to read a centain number of braille words per minute or to independently identify money and tell
                time. ILPs are reassessed every three months to track progress and adjust learning goals
                as needed. These plans guide instruction and ensures that every child's unique learning needs
                are met.</p>
            <p>The curriculum blends evidence-based literacy approaches adapted for visually impairments.
                Braille instruction, both contracted and uncontracted, forms the core of tactile literacy, While
                auditory-based phonics lessons develop phonological awareness. Large-print materials, high-contrast
                visual aids, and text-to-speech technology support  learners with residual vision. Listening 
                comprehension,vocabulary building, story retelling,and functional literacy tasks, such as 
                reading timetables or forms are incorporated to ensure that learners can apply their skills
                in real-life context. Life skills and orintation sessions complement literacy lessons to support
                holistic development.
